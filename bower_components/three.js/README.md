Three.js on Bower
------

Current version: [r64](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/releases/tag/r64)

Visit official repo if you want to know more:

https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js#threejs

Original repo is too large for Bower, so I got this:

```
wget http://threejs.org/build/three.min.js
```

### Usage

```
bower install --save three.js
```
